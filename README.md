# Walmart Sales Demand Forecasting - RNN, LSTM, GRU, LGBM

This project tackles the challenge of forecasting daily product demand across Walmart stores using real-world sales, pricing, and event data provided in the M5 Forecasting competition. We evaluate multiple models including LightGBM, LSTM/GRU, and Seq2Seq GRU, balancing forecasting accuracy with speed, interpretability, and deployability.

## üìå Objectives

- Forecast item-level sales over a 28-day horizon
- Support smarter inventory and replenishment decisions
- Compare traditional ML (LightGBM) with deep learning models
- Prioritize interpretability, efficiency, and business alignment

---

## üß† Models Explored

### ‚úÖ LightGBM
- Fast and interpretable
- Extensive feature engineering (lags, price dynamics, calendar)

### ‚úÖ LSTM & GRU
- Sequence models using 14-day input windows
- Event-aware forecasts with rolling predictions

### ‚úÖ Seq2Seq GRU
- One-shot 28-day global forecast
- Lightweight, fast to train, with transposed sales input

---

## üìä Key Findings

- GRU outperformed all models with the lowest WRMSSE score
- LightGBM was interpretable but underperformed on sequence trends
- Seq2Seq GRU was the most efficient but less accurate due to limited features

---

## üèÅ Results

- Final GRU model: best trade-off between accuracy, training time, and resource usage
- Presentation and write-up summarize both technical and business insights
